# Monday Retro 

*Today's retro we did What went well and even better if. We looped round the group twice noting things that were
 great and this that we could do better.
 We Then discussed expectations and targets for tomorrow.*

## What Went Well

- Learing about node + express - was exciting to do something totally new 
- Feel more confident that we can build something with all these new programmes
- Planned well, devoted a good amount of time to planning scedules, feedback structures and group time
- Able to build a consensus by weighing up pro's and cons
- Learnt alot, by going away and then coming back and feedbacking back to the group. Felt fast paced. 
- Natural delegation developed, we each found different gaps we needed to fill in our collective lnowledge.

## Even Better If
  
 - Not done alot of programming (however, we agreed that spending time learning and planning should speed future progress)
 - Smaller decisions could maybe be made with timer, so we don't spend too long deliberating over smaller tasks.
 - Stand up in the morning, we could set goals 
 - *From slack later that day* we rotate who runs the retro on a daily basis
 
 ## Targets for tomorrow
 
  - All blocking tickets done before lunch (sign up particular)
  - 2 More tickets done and reviewed by end of day (4 in total)
  - Have our first merge party by the end
  - Mob programme in the morning
  - Plan a group lunch in the week 

## Standup Structure tomorrow
  - Start at 9:30 (ideally)
  - Review tickets for the day 
  - Expectation/target setting
  - Set out what we did/will do
