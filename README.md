# NodoBnB


## Scenario

It's been a busy week, you've been working hard in the widgets factory, and you want to enjoy a holiday. If **only** there was a website that let people list spaces to stay in, ~~there is already, its called airbnb~~ well never fear! Nodobnb is here, with its sleek design and welcoming homepage, you'll already feel like you're already on holiday when you visit out site.

## Approach

As a team, our focus was to use the week to experiment with different technologies and see which best fitted our needs. We decided to try out both Node and Ruby for this project, and have learnt alot about both through it. 

Although we ended up going with ruby, we really liked the Italian (thanks @Giada) for Node, so in honour of our javascript friend we stuck with Nodo (Rubinobnb just didn't have the same ring to it.)
